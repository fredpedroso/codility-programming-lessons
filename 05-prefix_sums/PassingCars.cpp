  @class: PassingCars

  @brief:
	A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.
	The consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive cars on a road.

	Array A contains only 0s and/or 1s:
		0 represents a car traveling east,
		1 represents a car traveling west.

	The goal is to count passing cars.
	We say that a pair of cars (P, Q), where 0 <= P < Q < N,
	Is passing when P is traveling to the east and Q is traveling to the west.

	For example, consider array A such that:
		A[0] = 0
		A[1] = 1
		A[2] = 0
		A[3] = 1
		A[4] = 1
	We have five pairs of passing cars: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4).

	Write a function:
	int solution(vector<int> &A);

	That, given a non-empty array A of N integers, returns the number of pairs of passing cars.
	The function should return âˆ’1 if the number of pairs of passing cars exceeds 1,000,000,000.

	For example, given:
		A[0] = 0
		A[1] = 1
		A[2] = 0
		A[3] = 1
		A[4] = 1
	The function should return 5, as explained above.

	Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
	- N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
	- Each element of array A is an integer that can have one of the following values: 0, 1.
